## Week 1
Revisited Euclid's Division Algorithm.
Got introduced to Diophantine Equations.
Got familiar with Modular Arithmetic and Linear Congruences.



## Week 2
This week was mostly about the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
Also about Primes and their interesting properties.
(Lighter Week) 

## Week 3
This week was on prime numbers and primality testing. 
Started with The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
Interesting Totient Function.
The Riemann-Zeta Function!!
Got to know about several methods for primality testing.
(An Awesome method from IITK).

## Week 4
This week was about RSA system and it's implementation.
(Hard time working with large numbers in C.)

## Week 5
Was about applications of Number Theory for Pseudo-Random-Number Generation and
Introduction to Hashing and Hash Data Structures.
